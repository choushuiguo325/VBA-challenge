# VBA-challenge


A script "VBAStock solution.vbs" is created inside the VBAStocks folder, which loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.


Conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red is utilized.
